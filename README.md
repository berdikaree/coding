Final Duty Project - Islamic Boarding School

This repository represents a project that was part of my final duty in an Islamic boarding school. The project holds a special place in my heart as it reflects the memories and efforts I put into it during my time there. While the project may not be actively maintained, it is preserved here for nostalgia and as a reminder of my valuable experiences with friends and teachers.
Tech Stack

The project was developed using the following technologies:

    HTML
    CSS
    PHP Laravel
    Bootstrap
    MySQL

I used these technologies at a fundamental level, which was enough for my project requirements.
